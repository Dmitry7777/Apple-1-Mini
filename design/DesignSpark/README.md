# Schematic & PCB design

You need to download [DesignSpark PCB 8](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/pcb-software) to view & edit the schematic and PCB. 
Add the components folder to your component library first!  
 
The schematic is also [available as PDF](https://github.com/DutchMaker/Apple-1-Replica/blob/master/design/DesignSpark/revision1/schematic%20-%20Schematic.pdf).
