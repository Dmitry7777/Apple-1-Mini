# Data Uploader utility

## Upload memory data to the Apple 1 Mini

It's difficult to upload data to the Apple 1 Mini using most standard terminal clients because there need to be specific delays in between data being sent.  
This utility simplifies that process.  

Simply connect your Apple 1 Mini, run the utility, select a COM port and file to upload and the utility will handle the rest!
